# Task 

Problem Description:

Write the menu driven program using JDBC which will have following options:

a. Store

b. Display by id

c. Delete by id

d. Update salary by id

e. Exit

The menu should repeat until you enter exit, however the other options must perform
operation like storing in the database, displaying the item based on the id, deleting the
item based on id, updating the salary of the item based on id. The item has to be an
Employee with properties like id, name, salary and designation. Employee properties
must be initialized dynamically and also program must ask the id dynamically to
perform display and delete and for update id and salary must be dynamic. 

Sample Table Structure :

EMPLOYEE_ID  -- EMPLOYEE_NAME --  EMPLOYEE_SALARY

100      ,      Harish     ,       28000

101      ,       Vijay       ,     25000

102     ,        Ajay       ,       31000
